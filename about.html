<h1>Hello There!</h1>

<div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	My name is Deepankar Agrawal, and I work as a fullstack engineer at <a href="https://skit.ai">Skit.ai</a> [Previously Vernacular.ai]. 
	I have a keen interest in physics engines and computational graphics and enjoy the thrill of delving into complex
	systems, unraveling their mysteries, and even implementing them from scratch to gain a deeper understanding.
</p>

<p>
	When not immersed in the world of technology, I enjoy reading books, particularly in the enchanting realms of fantasy
	and sci-fi. My favorite book series is Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Apart from these things, I also like to learn different programming languages. I believe that each of them have their
	strengths, weaknesses and interesting concepts. For quite sometime I have been obsessed with Rust, I find its
	concept very intriguing and it feels so satisfying to write. I truly believe that its the programming language
	of the future.
