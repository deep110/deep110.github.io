<h2><i>I once wrote a code, that killed the zombies!!</i></h2>

<h1>Hello There!</h1>

<div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	My name is Deepankar Agrawal, and I work as a fullstack engineer at <a href="https://vernacular.ai">Vernacular.ai</a>. I enjoy experimenting with physics engines and graphics. I like opening black boxes and implementing them myself to understand them. My other hobbies include reading books [especially fantasy and sci-fi] and playing table tennis.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Apart from these, I also like to learn different programming languages. I believe that each of them have their strengths, defects and interesting concepts. For quite sometime I have been obsessed with Rust, I find its concept so intriguing and it feels so satisfying to write. I truly believe that it is the programming language of the future.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	By the way if you would ask me why would anyone follow my blog, I really don't have anything to say in the favour. It has been around for sometime but I haven't gotten around writing much. But in future I hope to write more about my so called experiments and sometimes, challenges I face at my work.
