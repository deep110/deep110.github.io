<h1>Hello There!</h1>

<div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	My name is Deepankar Agrawal, and I work as a fullstack engineer at <a href="https://skit.ai">Skit.ai</a> [Previously Vernacular.ai]. I enjoy experimenting with physics engines and computational graphics. I like opening black boxes and implementing them myself to understand them. My other hobbies include reading books [especially fantasy and sci-fi] and playing badminton.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	Apart from these, I also like to learn different programming languages. I believe that each of them have their strengths, weaknesses and interesting concepts. For quite sometime I have been obsessed with Rust, I find its concept very intriguing and feel so satisfying to write it. I truly believe that its the programming language of the future.
