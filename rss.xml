I wanted to understand audio codecs, so I implemented some of the popular decoders [wav, flac, mp3] in Rust. Library is also available on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cauldron">crates.io</a>.</p>

It creates a new process that have its own process-id (pid) tree, network and host. It also dives little into control groups to place limits on number of process that can be started by the application.</p>

would you want to implement your own. Well it may be that you don't like any of them, or just thinking of starting a game and implementing your own engine might be a good idea, then please don't do it and this article might not be for you. But if you (like me), want to learn nitty-gritty of a physics engine, this could be a good exercise.</p>

It uses Newton's laws of motion and conservation of momentum to solve collision constraints. You can find the detailed writeup <a href="https://deep110.github.io/posts/blogs/2019-01-13-implementing-2D-game-engine.html">here</a> explaining the concepts I used.</p>
