The trip was an exhilarating - from cities to beaches, boat trips to islands and gorgeous hills gradually dropping down to magnificent blue sea. The view of cappadocia valleys from the hot air balloon was breathtaking. Since, I love history my time in Ephesus &amp; Hierapolis ruins felt very insufficient. The tourist guides were really cool, helpful and knew better English than most of our hotel receptionists.</p>
