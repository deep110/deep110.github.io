Before going I did my research and imagined it to be many things but I was not ready for the modernization that I experienced.

> This is just my travel log so that few years down the line I remember it as vividly as I do it now. For tips and other stuff please follow professional travel writers. Also all images are clicked by me.

We took the flight from Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport to Istanbul International Airport via Dubai.

<br>

The journey was bit long, almost 9 hours including the waiting time in Dubai. Turkey is UTC/GMT +3 hours so 2.5 hrs back from India. We were happy that we will get little bit time to explore night life in istanbul. Sadly we were tired and didn't do much, just looked around for vegetarian food and changed our Euro to Turkish lira (₺).

## Istanbul

Istanbul formerly known as Constantinople during Byzantine period is the largest city in turkey. It is divided by bosphorus strait thus lying in both Asia and Europe.

#### Taksim square

Our hotel was near Taksim Square so we started our trip by roaming around the streets of taksim. You can find lots of vendors selling chestnuts which smells enticing in the cold winds of April.

We even found lot of ice cream shops eager to give us the infamous Turkish Ice Cream show.

#### Grand Bazaar

Then we went grand bazaar to put our bargaining skills to test. It is said to be biggest street shopping area with more than 4000 shops. You can find shops selling jewelry, crockery, turkish baklawa, carpets, souvenirs, and lots of other items. It is super easy to get lost in there and even you might not cross the same shop again.

#### Hagia Sophia

[Hagia Sophia](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia) is one of the most visited tourist attraction in whole turkey. Formerly it was a cathedral [world's largest for a thousand years] which was converted to mosque after the fall of Constantinople. You can clearly see the eastern roman architecture with mix of islamic elements.

Watch Netflix's [Rise of Empires - Ottomon](https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80990771) to understand the significance of Hagia Sophia and its importance to the city of Constantinople.

#### Topkapi Palace

[Topkapi Palace](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Topkap%C4%B1_Palace) was former resident of the Ottomon Sultans in 15th and 16th century, which is now converted to a large museum. It is very near to the Hagia Sophia and is easily reachable by the foot since we were in that area. It is divided into four courtyards:
1. **First Courtyard** act as a garden.
2. **Second Courtyard** has palace kitchens, imperial treasury, imperial council where ministers & sultan discuss affairs with each other, and weaponry.
3. **Third Courtyard** mainly contains audience chamber where sultan received his guests. It also has more than 400 rooms for residents living in the palace.
4. **Fourth Courtyard** was the innermost sanctuary of the Sultan and his family. It also offers a great view of the istanbul along the bosphorus strait.

#### Sultan Ahmed Mosque - The Blue Mosque

Sitting infront of Hagia Sophia is the [Blue Mosque](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mosque,_Istanbul), famous for its six minarets. The guide told us that when the mosque was ready with its "altı minare" (six minarets), at time it was a unique feature of the [mosque of the Ka'aba](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Mosque_of_Mecca) in Mecca, sultan was criticized for his presumption. So he ordered a seventh minaret to be built at the Mecca mosque to calm down the situation.

Sadly we were not able to go inside the mosque because it was closed to visiters.

#### Arasta Bazaar

Just beside the blue mosque is one of the traditional bazaar of istanbul - arasta bazaar, famous for selling textiles, carpets, spices and lots of souvenirs. We also did a bit of shopping here, it was too beautiful to ignore.

#### Exploring our Hotel - The Grand Hyatt

#### Princes’ Islands - Büyükada

[Princes' Islands](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes%27_Islands) are group of nine islands in Marmara Sea, we just visited the biggest one Büyükada which means **Big Island** in Turkish. In Byzantine and Ottoman times many royalty were exiled here hence earning its name. Right now also it does not have large population. Only people living here are ones who have retired or want a peaceful life away from busy city of Istanbul.

**Reaching the Islands**

To go to the island we took a ferry from Kabataş. It was a mesmerizing and chilly 1.5 hours ride.

  </div>
</section>

Since all motorized vehicles are forbidden here [except service vehicles] you can explore the islands by foot or rent a bicycle. We rented a electric bicycle but one of us was not able to ride it properly so we dropped the idea. We mainly explored it by foot and later on by small electric buses operated by some company I guess. A large area of island is still covered by forests.

Also we got to know that earlier horse carriages was also available for transport but was banned in late 2019 because of bad treatment of horses.

#### Bosphorus Cruise

At night we went for a 3 hours cruise along the bosphorus strait where one side you can see Asia and other side you can see Europe. There was also Turkish folk dance and belly dance show. The part that I liked was there were people of different nations, and you get dance on music of different cultures.

Since it was little jam packed with people, we did not enjoyed it that much. I think going on a yacht cruise would have been a better option. Maybe next time :).

Anyways this ended our trip in Istanbul, now on to next city - Kuşadası.

## Kuşadası

Kuşadası is a beach resort town on Turkey’s western Aegean coast. It does not have airport we flew to Izmir and took a cab to Kuşadası. We checked in around noon and decided to explore the hotel first then walk around the town.

#### Exploring our hotel - Charisma Deluxe Hotel

Our hotel was located just on the sea shore. It was beautiful, anyways judge yourself.

#### Walk to Güvercinada

Güvercinada or Pigeon Island in Turkish is named because of lots of pigeons found in the area. The island island is connected to the mainland by a causeway. It also has a beautiful fort on the which was built by Ottomans around 15th century AD for defending the city.

Walk from our hotel to the island was really fun and enjoyable. What more do you need, sea on one side and beautiful weather with lots of enjoyable sights on other side.

#### House of the Virgin Mary

Next day we started our tour by visiting the house of virgin mary which is now converted to chapel. It is believed that she was taken to this house by Saint John and lived year for remainder of her life.

The tour guide told us how it was discovered, which is actually a fascinating story. It was discovered in 19th century by following the description of visions by Anne Catherine Emmerich, a Roman Catholic nun and visionary.

#### Ephesus Tour

[Ephesus](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus) was an ancient greek city later was captured by Romans. Ephesus was a prosperous city under the rule of romans, because of the trade through sea route. The city lost its importance in later years because harbor got shifted away. It was also partially destroyed around 6th Century AD due to earthquakes. One of the most important structure in ephesus is [Temple Of Artemis](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis) which is considered one the seven [wonders of the Ancient World](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World) but nothing of it remains. The temple would bring lots of visitors to the city adding to its wealth.

The guide walked us through some of the structures that still remains or was reconstructed from the ruins obtained during excavation. It was declared as UNESCO World Heritage site in 2015.

This ended our trip in Kuşadası, now on to next city - Pamukkale.

## Pamukkale

[Pamukkale](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamukkale) meaning **Cotton Castle** in Turkish is located in southwestern Turkey. It is famous for calcium carbonate mineral left by flowing thermal waters [i.e hot springs]. We took a car from kusadasi to pamukkale. Along the way we saw lot of power plants making use of geothermal energy.
