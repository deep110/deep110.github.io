Vietnam is a country of contrasts. It is a land of ancient traditions and modern cities, of lush jungles and towering mountains, of friendly people and delicious food. My knowledge of Vietnam was largely limited to what I had read about the [Vietnam War](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) in history textbooks. However, when my friends suggested we go on a trip to Vietnam, I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about this fascinating country with rich history and culture.

> This is just my personal travel log which I write so that few years down the line I remember it as vividly as I do it right now. For tips and other stuff please follow professional bloggers. Also, all the images/videos are clicked by me.

## Our Journey

Our journey began in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon. We arrived in the morning and were immediately struck by the hustle and bustle of the city. We visited the Cu Chi Tunnels, which is a sobering reminder of the Vietnam War. We also visited the Ben Thanh Market, where we wandered the stalls and bought souvenirs. 

After spending two days there, we proceeded to DaLat by bus. DaLat is a city in the mountains, and the climate is much cooler than in Ho Chi Minh City. We also visited the Crazy House, a unique hotel that is built in the shape of a tree.

From Da Lat, we flew to Da Nang - A coastal city which is known for its beaches and its Buddhist temples. It felt like **Goa of Vietnam**. We spend the day roaming around the beaches and in the evening we went HoiAn, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it is known for its well-preserved ancient town. We spent our day wandering the streets of the old town, admiring the traditional Chinese shop-houses and the Japanese merchant houses. The next day, we took a cable car to the top of Ba Na Hills. Ba Na Hills is a mountain resort, and it is home to a number of attractions, including the famous Golden Bridge, a French village, and a cable car station.

After DaNang we went to Hanoi. We roamed around some markets and prepared for our next day trip to Ha long bay cruise. Cruising through the bay, we felt as though I was sailing through an artist's masterpiece, exploring hidden caves and mesmerizing sea. Next day we came back to Hanoi and visited famous places like Train Street, St Joseph Cathedral, markets, Hoan Kiem Lake, etc.

## Ho Chi Minh City { #hochiminh }

Ho Chi Minh City is the vibrant metropolis of Vietnam that is fascinating tapestry of rich history, diverse culture, mouthwatering cuisine, and bustling nightlife. Formerly and still commonly known as **Saigon**[^rf_hcmc] is well known for its well-preserved French colonial architecture, historic landmarks, walking streets, museums and galleries. It also contains The Reunification Palace, once the residence of South Vietnam's president, holds significant importance as the site where the Vietnam War ended.

Seeing the beautiful and modern skyscrapers surrounding the saigon river was such a mesmerizing experience. It completely changed my perspective of Vietnam as a country.

#### Cu Chi Tunnels

Located just outside the city, the Cu Chi Tunnels are an important historical site from the Vietnam War. It served as a vital base for the Viet Cong, a communist guerrilla group fighting against both the South Vietnamese government and the United States during the Vietnam War.

We were able to witness and experience various aspects of the underground system. The guide provided us with insights into the history, tactics, and daily life of the Viet Cong soldiers. The demonstrations of trapdoors and hidden entrances, crawling through narrow tunnel sections, and witnessing the ingenuity of the underground infrastructure like ways to hide smoke from kitchen, trapping enemies in tunnels, etc was very fascinating.  Crawling through tunnel was very claustrophobia inducing, and really gave a glimpse into the harsh realities of vietnamese soldiers during war.

The Cu Chi Tunnels tour is a significant and thought-provoking journey that sheds light on a critical period in Vietnam's history. It offers visitors a chance to understand the hardships faced by those involved in the conflict and provides a perspective on the war from a Vietnamese standpoint.

#### Saigon River WaterBus Tour

The Saigon River tour was such a delightful and relaxing way to explore the scenic beauty of Ho Chi Minh City. It gave unique vantage point to admire Ho Chi Minh City's stunning skyline. The modern skyscrapers, historic landmarks, and architectural wonders along the riverbanks create a fascinating juxtaposition of the old and new, showcasing the city's development over the years.

We booked a two way ticket so that we can experience the ride for longer and also get dropped at starting again.

#### Bitexco Financial Tower

Just like Burj Khalifa of Dubai, The Bitexco Financial Tower tour offers an unforgettable experience that allows visitors to appreciate the beauty of Ho Chi Minh City from above. It is the tallest building of the city and is a prominent landmark on the city's skyline. It is very much visible during the saigon river tour.

We went to the building's observation deck which is located on the 49th floor and is accessible via high-speed elevators. From this vantage point, we were able to get 360-degree view of Ho Chi Minh City, including its historic landmarks, bustling streets, and the meandering Saigon River. The floor-to-ceiling glass windows offered unobstructed views, allowing us to capture stunning photographs.

#### Phuongnam Lacquerware Visit

Lacquerware is a traditional Vietnamese art form that involves applying layers of natural lacquer to create exquisite and durable items such as plates, vases, bowls, trays, and decorative pieces. During the visit, we were able to watch the artisans as they apply multiple layers of lacquer, create intricate designs, and add decorative elements using eggshells, mother-of-pearl, or gold leaf.

At the end, there was a huge souvenir shop which had large collection of lacquerware from delicate floral patterns to vibrant landscapes. The art on the pieces usually reflect Vietnam's rich cultural heritage and artistic traditions.

#### Ben Thanh Market

Ben Thanh Market is one of the most famous and iconic market in Ho Chi Minh City for buying local souvenirs, clothing, footwear, accessories, handicrafts, textiles, and more. It's an excellent place to buy traditional Vietnamese products and take home unique keepsakes.

Bargaining is a very common practice at the market. We really got good prices for some of stuff like t-shirts, bamboo handbags, etc. My wife didn't missed a single chance to show her bargaining skills that day.

#### Bui Vien Street

Bui Vien Street, is a lively and vibrant thoroughfare located in the heart of city. It is a popular destination for both local Vietnamese and international travelers, particularly backpackers, looking for a lively and energetic nightlife scene.

The street is lined with bars, pubs, clubs, and restaurants, each offering a unique experience. We were able to enjoy live music, karaoke, sports screenings, and a wide variety of drinks and cocktails. Coming from India, the place was a cultural shock in a good way though. Anyways we really had a good time since we stayed till the closing time :p.

Anyways after spending two memorable days we took a overnight bus to DaLat.

## DaLat { #dalat }

DaLat is an enchanting destination that offers a picturesque escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It is what you call a typical hill station in India. Our stay there was very peaceful.

#### Crazy House

We started our tour of DaLat with Crazy House, an architectural marvel that seems to have sprung from a fairy tale. This surreal structure, captivated us with its whimsical design, resembling a maze of treehouses and caves. We explored the labyrinth of winding staircases, secret passages, and artistic nooks, feeling like curious adventurers in a magical world.

We were surprised to know that some parts of it is also a hotel. Anyways after that we went to Dantala falls.
