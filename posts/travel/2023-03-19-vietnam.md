Vietnam is a country of contrasts. It is a land of ancient traditions and modern cities, of lush jungles and towering mountains, of friendly people and delicious food. My knowledge of Vietnam was largely limited to what I had read about the [Vietnam War](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) in history textbooks. However, when my friends suggested we go on a trip to Vietnam, I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about this fascinating country with rich history and culture.

> This is just my personal travel log which I write so that few years down the line I remember it as vividly as I do it right now. For tips and other stuff please follow professional bloggers. Also, all the images/videos are clicked by me.

## Our Journey

Our journey began in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon. We arrived in the morning and were immediately struck by the hustle and bustle of the city. We visited the Cu Chi Tunnels, which is a sobering reminder of the Vietnam War. We also visited the Ben Thanh Market, where we wandered the stalls and bought souvenirs. 

After spending two days there, we proceeded to DaLat by bus. DaLat is a city in the mountains, and the climate is much cooler than in Ho Chi Minh City. We also visited the Crazy House, a unique hotel that is built in the shape of a tree.

From Da Lat, we flew to Da Nang - A coastal city which is known for its beaches and its Buddhist temples. It felt like **Goa of Vietnam**. We spend the day roaming around the beaches and in the evening we went HoiAn, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it is known for its well-preserved ancient town. We spent our day wandering the streets of the old town, admiring the traditional Chinese shop-houses and the Japanese merchant houses. The next day, we took a cable car to the top of Ba Na Hills. Ba Na Hills is a mountain resort, and it is home to a number of attractions, including the famous Golden Bridge, a French village, and a cable car station.

After DaNang we went to Hanoi. We roamed around some markets and prepared for our next day trip to Ha long bay cruise. Cruising through the bay, we felt as though I was sailing through an artist's masterpiece, exploring hidden caves and mesmerizing sea. Next day we came back to Hanoi and visited famous places like Train Street, St Joseph Cathedral, markets, Hoan Kiem Lake, etc.
