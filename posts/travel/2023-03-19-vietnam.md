Vietnam is a country of contrasts. It is a land of ancient traditions and modern cities, of lush jungles and towering mountains, of friendly people and delicious food. My knowledge of Vietnam was largely limited to what I had read about the [Vietnam War](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) in history textbooks. However, when my friends suggested we go on a trip to Vietnam, I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about this fascinating country with rich history and culture.

> This is just my personal travel log which I write so that few years down the line I remember it as vividly as I do it right now. For tips and other stuff please follow professional bloggers. Also, all the images/videos are clicked by me.

## Our Journey

Our journey began in Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon. We arrived in the morning and were immediately struck by the hustle and bustle of the city. We visited the Cu Chi Tunnels, which is a sobering reminder of the Vietnam War. We also visited the Ben Thanh Market, where we wandered the stalls and bought souvenirs. 

After spending two days there, we proceeded to DaLat by bus. DaLat is a city in the mountains, and the climate is much cooler than in Ho Chi Minh City. We also visited the Crazy House, a unique hotel that is built in the shape of a tree.

From Da Lat, we flew to Da Nang - A coastal city which is known for its beaches and its Buddhist temples. It felt like **Goa of Vietnam**. We spend the day roaming around the beaches and in the evening we went HoiAn, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it is known for its well-preserved ancient town. We spent our day wandering the streets of the old town, admiring the traditional Chinese shop-houses and the Japanese merchant houses. The next day, we took a cable car to the top of Ba Na Hills. Ba Na Hills is a mountain resort, and it is home to a number of attractions, including the famous Golden Bridge, a French village, and a cable car station.

After DaNang we went to Hanoi. We roamed around some markets and prepared for our next day trip to Ha long bay cruise. Cruising through the bay, we felt as though I was sailing through an artist's masterpiece, exploring hidden caves and mesmerizing sea. Next day we came back to Hanoi and visited famous places like Train Street, St Joseph Cathedral, markets, Hoan Kiem Lake, etc.

## Ho Chi Minh City { #hochiminh }

Ho Chi Minh City is the vibrant metropolis of Vietnam that is fascinating tapestry of rich history, diverse culture, mouthwatering cuisine, and bustling nightlife. Formerly and still commonly known as **Saigon**[^rf_hcmc] is well known for its well-preserved French colonial architecture, historic landmarks, walking streets, museums and galleries. It also contains The Reunification Palace, once the residence of South Vietnam's president, holds significant importance as the site where the Vietnam War ended.

Seeing the beautiful and modern skyscrapers surrounding the saigon river was such a mesmerizing experience. It completely changed my perspective of Vietnam as a country.

#### Cu Chi Tunnels

Located just outside the city, the Cu Chi Tunnels are an important historical site from the Vietnam War. It served as a vital base for the Viet Cong, a communist guerrilla group fighting against both the South Vietnamese government and the United States during the Vietnam War.

We were able to witness and experience various aspects of the underground system. The guide provided us with insights into the history, tactics, and daily life of the Viet Cong soldiers. The demonstrations of trapdoors and hidden entrances, crawling through narrow tunnel sections, and witnessing the ingenuity of the underground infrastructure like ways to hide smoke from kitchen, trapping enemies in tunnels, etc was very fascinating.  Crawling through tunnel was very claustrophobia inducing, and really gave a glimpse into the harsh realities of vietnamese soldiers during war.

The Cu Chi Tunnels tour is a significant and thought-provoking journey that sheds light on a critical period in Vietnam's history. It offers visitors a chance to understand the hardships faced by those involved in the conflict and provides a perspective on the war from a Vietnamese standpoint.

#### Saigon River WaterBus Tour

The Saigon River tour was such a delightful and relaxing way to explore the scenic beauty of Ho Chi Minh City. It gave unique vantage point to admire Ho Chi Minh City's stunning skyline. The modern skyscrapers, historic landmarks, and architectural wonders along the riverbanks create a fascinating juxtaposition of the old and new, showcasing the city's development over the years.

We booked a two way ticket so that we can experience the ride for longer and also get dropped at starting again.

#### Bitexco Financial Tower

Just like Burj Khalifa of Dubai, The Bitexco Financial Tower tour offers an unforgettable experience that allows visitors to appreciate the beauty of Ho Chi Minh City from above. It is the tallest building of the city and is a prominent landmark on the city's skyline. It is very much visible during the saigon river tour.

We went to the building's observation deck which is located on the 49th floor and is accessible via high-speed elevators. From this vantage point, we were able to get 360-degree view of Ho Chi Minh City, including its historic landmarks, bustling streets, and the meandering Saigon River. The floor-to-ceiling glass windows offered unobstructed views, allowing us to capture stunning photographs.

#### Phuongnam Lacquerware Visit

Lacquerware is a traditional Vietnamese art form that involves applying layers of natural lacquer to create exquisite and durable items such as plates, vases, bowls, trays, and decorative pieces. During the visit, we were able to watch the artisans as they apply multiple layers of lacquer, create intricate designs, and add decorative elements using eggshells, mother-of-pearl, or gold leaf.

At the end, there was a huge souvenir shop which had large collection of lacquerware from delicate floral patterns to vibrant landscapes. The art on the pieces usually reflect Vietnam's rich cultural heritage and artistic traditions.

#### Ben Thanh Market

Ben Thanh Market is one of the most famous and iconic market in Ho Chi Minh City for buying local souvenirs, clothing, footwear, accessories, handicrafts, textiles, and more. It's an excellent place to buy traditional Vietnamese products and take home unique keepsakes.

Bargaining is a very common practice at the market. We really got good prices for some of stuff like t-shirts, bamboo handbags, etc. My wife didn't missed a single chance to show her bargaining skills that day.

#### Bui Vien Street

Bui Vien Street, is a lively and vibrant thoroughfare located in the heart of city. It is a popular destination for both local Vietnamese and international travelers, particularly backpackers, looking for a lively and energetic nightlife scene.

The street is lined with bars, pubs, clubs, and restaurants, each offering a unique experience. We were able to enjoy live music, karaoke, sports screenings, and a wide variety of drinks and cocktails. Coming from India, the place was a cultural shock, though in a good way. Anyways we really had a good time since we stayed till the closing time :p.

Anyways after spending two memorable days we took a overnight bus to DaLat.

## DaLat { #dalat }

DaLat is an enchanting destination that offers a picturesque escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It is what you call a typical hill station in India. Our stay there was very peaceful.

#### Crazy House

We started our tour of DaLat with Crazy House, an architectural marvel that seems to have sprung from a fairy tale. This surreal structure, captivated us with its whimsical design, resembling a maze of treehouses and caves. We explored the labyrinth of winding staircases, secret passages, and artistic nooks, feeling like curious adventurers in a magical world.

</div>

We were surprised to know that some parts of it is also a hotel. Anyways after that we went to Dantala falls.

#### Datanla Falls

Dantanla Falls is a wonderful waterfall, located in the middle of Prenn Pass about few kilometers south of Da Lat city center. You can either use the roller coaster or walk along the stream to reach the actual falls. Naturally we took the roller coaster to climb up the hills. The falls itself was not very different from numerous others I had seen.

</div>

Apart from the falls there is an abundance of thrilling activities to keep boredom at bay. Its little bit difficult to get a cab here since it is far from main city, so try to book a car in advance.

#### Clay Sculpture Tunnel

Dalat sculpture tunnel was built and built next by Tuyen Lam lake in 2010 but was opened for tourists in 2014. Upon entering you will be able to admire the majestic natural scenery such as the elephant, monkeys, mountain forests Langbiang - this is considered the process of simulating the period of wild Da Lat. Deeper inside the resort are architectural works such as the College of Pedagogy, Da Lat Station, Con Ga Church, etc . all these symbols as evidence for the process of the development of Da Lat city.

Near the end of tour is Ho Vo Cuc (infinity pool), which is must-visit within the vicinity of Clay Tunnel. It boasts a serene and picturesque landscape, offering breathtaking panoramic views of the majestic mountains and meandering rivers stretching into the distance.

#### Xuan Huong Lake

Xuan Huong Lake is a symbol of Da Lat that everyone who comes here will come to visit. Surrounding Xuan Huong Lake are famous historical and cultural sites, beautiful and good hotels.

<div class="carousel" aria-label="Xuan Huong Lake">
    <ul class="carousel-list">

</div>

Apart from walking around the lake you can also ride a swan paddle boat or take a horse ride. Near the lake is Dalat Market which you can visit to scratch that shopping bug. We stayed near the lake till the night and called it a day.

#### Truc Lam Monastery

Before leaving Da Lat we visited Truc Lam Monastery, which attracts a lot of tourists and locals who come to witness the beautiful landscapes, enjoy the calm atmosphere, and practice Buddhism. This pagoda is such a peaceful getaway for those who are under stress or sorrow. You can know more about history of the monastery in this article[^rf_dtm].

<div class="carousel" aria-label="Truc Lam Monastery">

    <ul class="carousel-indicators"></ul>
</div>

Since we did not had much time, we left the monastery pretty quickly. This ended our stay at Da Lat and we left for Da Nang via flight.

## Da Nang { #danang }

Nestled along the central coast of Vietnam, the bustling city of Da Nang beckons travelers with its fusion of ancient traditions and modern allure. I found myself drawn to its pristine beaches and lively waterfront promenade. From the iconic Dragon Bridge ablaze with neon lights to the tranquil shores of My Khe Beach, the city pulsated with an energy that was both invigorating and inviting.

Apart from this I also visited Hoi An, a picturesque town renowned for its well-preserved ancient architecture and rich cultural heritage. Venturing further afield, I embarked on a scenic drive to the breathtaking heights of Bana Hills, a mountain retreat that offered a captivating blend of natural splendor and architectural marvels.

#### My Khe Beach

My Khe Beach is famous for its blue sky, smooth white sand, gentle slope, clear & warm water year round and beautiful areas surrounded by coconut trees. The lack of large waves, warm water year round and an average of 60 meter wide beach area, is ideal to chill around. It also offers magnificent sunrise scenery, so try to stay near the beach.

Alongside the stretch of golden sand contains various luxurious hotels, restaurants and world class beachfront resorts where you can stay. Even at night, the beach is illuminated by these establishments.

#### Dragon Bridge

The Dragon Bridge is constructed over the River Hàn. It provides the shortest road link from the Da Nang International Airport to other main roads in Da Nang city, so while coming from the airport you can't miss it. At night, it dazzles with a vibrant array of colors, enhancing its natural beauty.

It is said that bridge also breathes fire and water each Saturday and Sunday night at 9 pm. But sadly, we were not present on either of those days so we missed the show.

#### Marble Mountains

Marble Mountains is a group of five limestone peaks situated seven kilometers from downtown Da Nang. It is home to a network of caves, tunnels, towers, and pagodas built by Mahayana Buddhists and the Nguyen Dynasty Kings. The structures and shrines blend harmoniously with nature. Huyen Khong is the largest of the caves. The collapsed ceiling allows shafts of light to pierce the dark cavern, creating dramatic spotlights inside.

Huyen Khong was also once used as a secret base and later a field hospital for Vietnamese revolutionaries. Its jaw-dropping size seems unlikely from the entrance, but is large enough to house a massive stone Buddha and two shrines. It was almost evening when we left Marble Mountains.

#### Hội An

Hoi An as a place embodies a transition where rapid modernization gives way to a more relaxed pace. This former trading hub boasts a picturesque scene along the Thu Bon River, where historic shop houses and ancient pagodas stand weathered by time, and traditional sampans ferry passengers to and from the historic ferry terminal.

Like mentioned before it is registered as a UNESCO world heritage sight[^rf_dnh] and is recognized as well preserved example of ancient Asian Trading port. It is said that merchants from China, Japan and later Europe settled in Hoi An from the 15th to 19th centuries, creating a unique architectural fusion.

Apart from ancient architecture, as the night falls, the town turns into a magical wonderland, captivating visitors with its enchanting atmosphere and illuminated streets. Lanterns of all colors adorn the narrow alleyways and ancient buildings, casting a soft, ethereal glow that transports you to another time. Along the picturesque riverfront, you can enjoy panoramic views of the Thu Bon River shimmering with traditional lantern lit sampans.

#### Bà Nà Hills

Nestled amidst the lush landscapes, Ba Na Hills stands as a historic hill station and resort, with roots tracing back to its establishment in 1919. Once favored by the French elite for its charming villas and serene resort ambiance, Ba Na Hills fell into neglect over the years. However, a remarkable transformation ensued, evolving it into the vibrant and captivating theme park destination it is today.

Access to Ba Na Hills is exclusively via its awe-inspiring cable-car system, renowned globally for its remarkable infrastructure. Ranked among the top 10 most impressive cable-car systems worldwide, it proudly holds the world record for the "**longest non-stop single track cable car**", stretching an impressive 5,801 meters (19,032 feet) in length.

After that, we ventured onward to the charming **French Village** nestled within Ba Na Hills. This picturesque enclave exudes an enchanting ambiance reminiscent of a bygone era, with its quaint cobblestone streets, rustic architecture, and vibrant flower gardens. 

Entering this picturesque setting might have evoked the sensation of journeying to the French countryside, but with ongoing rains and us being late was met with cancellation of street performances and the closure of shops.

Continuing our exploration, we ventured into the vibrant theme park area, filled with exhilarating rides and attractions. The game zone provided endless entertainment, offering a variety of thrilling games and activities for visitors of all ages. We played multiple rounds of famous Arcade game [Dance Dance Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution).

Anyways, our adventure in Ba Na Hills was pretty awesome despite rains trying to ruin the day for us :p. This ended our stay in Da Nang, we retired early that night since we had to catch an early morning flight to next city on our itinerary - Hanoi.

## Hanoi { #hanoi }

Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam, is a vibrant tapestry of history, culture, and modernity. Steeped in tradition yet pulsating with energy, Hanoi offers visitors a captivating blend of ancient charm and contemporary allure.

Once we reached Hanoi, firstly we went for Ha Long Bay cruise. Then we went for city tour and shopping in the markets.

#### Ha long Bay Cruise

Embarking on a cruise through Ha Long Bay was a breathtaking journey into one of Vietnam's most iconic natural wonders. From the moment we set sail, the limestone karsts rising majestically from the emerald waters created a scene of unparalleled beauty.

From the moment we stepped aboard, we were greeted by the warm and attentive staff, who ensured that our stay would be as enjoyable as the breathtaking scenery surrounding us. Our cabin was a cozy retreat with large windows that offered stunning views of the bay. The room was spacious and well-appointed, featuring a comfortable bed with plush linens, a seating area, and ample storage space. The ensuite bathroom was equally impressive, equipped with modern fixtures, a refreshing rain shower, and luxurious toiletries.

The cruise ship also offered a variety of common areas designed for relaxation and entertainment. The sundeck was a popular spot, with comfortable loungers and panoramic views of the bay. It was the perfect place to unwind with a book, enjoy a cocktail, or simply take in the breathtaking scenery.

One of the highlights of our cruise was the opportunity to go kayaking amidst the towering karsts. Paddling through crystal-clear waters, we navigated our way through the lagoon, immersing ourselves in the natural splendor of Ha Long Bay.

The cave attracts tourists from all over the world thanks to such picturesque and pristine charms featuring a stiff cliff, a peaceful green lake like a mirror throughout the year-long, and an impressive stalagmite system. The natural scenery is a splendid combination of great mountains, blue sky, emerald water, green plants, and fresh air.

In the afternoon, our cruise trip concluded. While we were sad to leave, we eagerly anticipated the next leg of our journey to Hanoi.


#### Train Street

Located in the heart of the bustling Old Quarter, Train Street is a narrow alley where inside the cafes that are lining the railway tracks, tourists eagerly await the arrival of the train. As the train approached, the atmosphere becomes electric, and we marveled at the sight of the massive locomotive rumbling past mere inches away.

Amidst the excitement, I couldn't help but feel a deep appreciation for the resilience and adaptability of the people who have built their lives alongside the railway tracks.

#### Tran Quoc Pagoda

Situated on a small peninsula jutting out into the picturesque West Lake, Tran Quoc Pagoda is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in Vietnam, dating back over 1,500 years.

As we stepped through the ornate gates, the surrounding landscape changed to meticulously landscaped lush gardens, ancient bonsai trees, and tranquil ponds dotted with blooming lotus flowers. As we reached the edge of the peninsula, we found a peaceful spot overlooking the shimmering waters of West Lake and spent some time enjoying in the sunset.

#### St. Joseph Cathedral

Situated in the historic Old Quarter, this majestic Gothic-style cathedral stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of Catholicism in Vietnam.

Stepping inside, a profound sense of peace and respect embraced me as shafts of sunlight filtered through the colorful stained glass, casting a warm glow over the interior. Coincidentally, Sunday mass was underway, further enriching the spiritual atmosphere of the moment. Well not much into the religious stuff we went out and clicked phots.

We explored the vibrant streets and enjoyed nightlife, hopping between pubs and strolling along the lakeside. Hanoi truly offers a diverse range of experiences for visitors to enjoy. We made a last-minute trip to [Dong Xuan Market](https://localvietnam.com/blog/dong-xuan-market/) to pick up some items for the family, including T-shirts, toys, and more.


## End Of Trip

As we bid farewell to this remarkable country, we carry with us a deep appreciation for its rich heritage and vibrant present. Our adventures in Vietnam have left an indelible mark on our hearts, and we look forward to returning someday to explore even more of its wonders. Until then, Vietnam's captivating blend of history, nature, and excitement, left us with memories to cherish for a lifetime.
