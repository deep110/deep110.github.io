Its a 2D Shapes pixel rendering library in rust. Some supported shapes are Line2D, Rectangle2D, Ellipse2D, Polygon2D and Bezier2D [Both quadratic and cubic]. I was working on creating a [verlet physics](https://github.com/deep110/verlet.rs) based system and wanted to visualize some output quickly. I explored some crates but didn't found anything good out there for pixel buffer.
