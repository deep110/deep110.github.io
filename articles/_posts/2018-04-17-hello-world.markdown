Finally, I have done it, my first blog has been compiled successfully.

I have been there, when the first line of code was written in my company. I have seen my company grow from 6 members to a team of 20+ members. I have seen microservices abused, deployments gone wrong, dreams of CI and CD crushed, servers blowing up, and of course piling server bills. So, working as a fullstack engineer and a guy who had been responsible for devops partly, I have faced numerous challenges along the way. I found solution to many of those problems in the types of blogs that I am aiming to write.

So I will be writing about problems that kept me awake for days or solutions that should be present on first link.

Apart from that I also love experimenting with game physics and shader graphics in Unity. So yes you will find many blogs on that too.
