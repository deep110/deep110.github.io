<h1>Hello There!</h1>

<div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So you have found my site. Awesome Job!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	My name is Deepankar Agrawal, and I work as a fullstack developer at <a href="https://vernacular.ai">Vernacular.ai</a>. 
	My main role at work is to put out fire and solve challenging issues that may hinder 
	the productivity of the team.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Due to this I have picked up some skills like Django, Nodejs for backend development 
and React, Redux for frontend. Apart from this I am a huge fan of Docker and have 
experience in dockerizing all kinds of app and deploying them to AWS or Google Cloud 
Platform. In my free time I like to play games, and much more interestingly to make them. 
I have tried my hands on making games for different platforms like PC, Android and Xbox 
using <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>. I like to donate most of my spare time 
into gamedev.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Apart from programming my other hobbies also include reading and playing Table-Tennis. 
I am a huge fan of sci-fi and fantasy genre novels.
